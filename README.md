# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street


## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Bonus

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:


Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.
